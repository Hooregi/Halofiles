    <description>Finance firms and headhunters are ultimately looking for hard working and smart candidates that they can get along with.

I start by introducing you to his background before giving him advice as to how to break into the industry. He comes from a physics background (masters in theoretical physics) and is looking to beef up his CV with quant research-related projects. Furthermore, he's looking for resources for more advances topics such as probability, data analysis, and option trading. Lastly, we talk about how he can level up his python skills so he can differentiate himself as a passionate candidate.</description>
